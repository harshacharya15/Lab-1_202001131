Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

# Lab-1_202001131

Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs: 

=> For Library Information System (LIS) :

=> Functional Requirements : 

1.  LIS system should ask to the user for the username and password which is already provided to the particular user , then when a user wants to issue or borrow the book. LIS system checks whether the entered credentials matches for example,Password is correct or not,or the entered username exists or not.
2.  LIS system should allow user to search for particular books in the library based on the various characteristics of book like from title of the book, Author name, Publication date or year, etc of the book according to their requirements of the user for the book.
3.  LIS system should contains all information of book and it shows all the necessary details of the book.
4.  If book is already borrowed then user must be the member of the system.As a Process of borrowing,Firsty any user will request for borrowing a book to the librarian and when a librarian acknowledges it, the book is finally borrowed by user.
5.  For the particular user, the system should display a list of the borrowed books,currently borrowed as well as previously borrowed book records, date of borrowing and returning books if the user wants the details of the past history.
6.  After the book is borrowed, the system would show the particular location of the book where it is in the library.
7.  It should allow the librarian to enter a new record into the system when any book is taken off the shelf and when new book has been purchased.System should notify the user as well as to the librarian of the overdue or overtime books and calculate the particular fine as per the conditions for the overdue books when they are returned back to the library.
8.  If the book is already borrowed by any other user, then the system shouldn’t give an option of borrowing to the user and tell the user that the book is borrowed by others.

=> Non - Functional Requirements : 

1.  Scalability - System should not give any types of error or failure and work reliably when there are multiple users accessing the system.
2.  Security - The system should firstly ask an user for a username and password for entering into the system. It should also make sure that the it runs on the institute LAN.
3.  Performance - The system should also respond to request within two to three seconds.
4.  Flexibility - System should make sure that the user can get relevant information easily. The UX/UI should be simple enough and user-friendly. Provide an option for choosing different languages makes the system easier.
5.  Maintainability - Updating information on the system should be made as easy as possible. The current system should work properly even if any changes are made. System should be updated by new features and updated features along with previous features should all work preoperly.
6.  Portability -  It is possible to access the database in any system other than the system in which it is created.
7.  Accuracy - LIS should ensure that the data stored about the books and about users and the fines calculates should be correct and consistent.

Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the given problem.

=> Scope : 

Currently,5% of the world population suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs.For them, in our society who are unable to communicate due to their disability. A deaf person cannot live alone, it requires another person to guide them. This application helps them to communicate with the outside world.

=> (Features) Functional Requirements : 

1.  Firstly, System should ask to choose the resulting tone, e.g. bell tone, car horns when an user wants immediate alerts.
2.  System should also allow you to choose the output type , in other words, it wants the output in the form of tone, vibration, or both tone and vibration.
3.  System should allow editing , delete voice information, voice types, etc.
4.  System should allow you to choose more than one voice requirement as a resulting tone for voice recognition.
5.  Users should choose where to send the information or alert  whether on mobile phone, email, or both.


=> Non - Functional Requirements : 

1.  System should recognize any voice in the list without any fault.
2.  Responding time of the system should be very fast and error-free and performance of the system should not decrease by time or usage.
3.  System should be with a good interface and with good UI/UX design.It’s easy to learn and use. 
4.  Admin and User should get notified in case any error or system failure occurs.
5.  System should support adding new voices without changing old voices
6.  The system should be compatible in all mobiles capable of running Android Programs.
7.  UI/UX should be user friendly and attractive and it contains images instead of text because it’s more understandable.
